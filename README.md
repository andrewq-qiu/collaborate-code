This is a personal project created over the Winter of 2020-2021. The application allows users to collaboratively edit a Python file on their browser in a similar manner to Google Docs. The purpose of this application is to faccilitate a more natural communication method for exchanging Computer Science or mathematical ideas across the Internet. Users are able to write Python together and draw diagrams directly on their code live.

This application applies algorithms from [Operational Transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation).
